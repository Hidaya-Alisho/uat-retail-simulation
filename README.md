Overview
This project is a simulation of a User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase for a fictional internal dashboard rollout at Costco. It is designed to reflect the core responsibilities of a Business Analyst—planning, executing, and reporting on UAT—to ensure quality, usability, and stakeholder alignment.

Objective
To demonstrate structured thinking, testing methodology, analytical reporting, and business communication—skills essential to a Business & Project Analyst role.

Scenario
Costco is set to deploy a new sales and inventory dashboard. As the analyst, I created a UAT plan, collected simulated tester feedback, tracked issues by severity, analyzed the results, and presented key findings in a final business report format.

Tools Used
Excel (UAT tracker, data logging, visualization)

PowerPoint (Stakeholder-ready insights presentation)

GitHub (Version control and project hosting)

Notion (Full case study walkthrough)

Notes
All data used is simulated for demonstration purposes.

The scope has been intentionally narrowed to reflect a focused UAT sample; I am fully capable of applying this methodology to large-scale, real-world datasets and cross-functional environments.
