# Retail UAT Simulation â€“ Business Analyst Case Study

This project simulates a User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase for a fictional internal dashboard rollout at Costco. It demonstrates how a Business Analyst plans, executes, and communicates UAT results to ensure product quality, user experience, and stakeholder alignment.

## Objective

To showcase structured thinking, testing methodology, stakeholder-ready reporting, and communicationâ€”core skills for a Business & Project Analyst role.

- Created a UAT plan and feedback tracker
- Logged and categorized test results by severity
- Analyzed key issues and failure patterns
- Presented findings in a stakeholder-ready summary deck

## Tools Used

- **Excel** â€“ Test tracker, data logging, severity analysis
- **PowerPoint (PDF)** â€“ Final stakeholder presentation
