# 🧪 Retail Dashboard UAT Simulation | Business Analyst Project

Welcome! This project is a **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) simulation** for a fictional retail dashboard rollout. It’s designed to demonstrate my skills as a **Business Analyst** — from test case tracking to data visualization and insight presentation.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is a self-initiated demo project using **entirely fictional data**. It is built for learning and portfolio purposes. While the dataset is small for demonstration, I am confident working with larger datasets and scaling this process for real-world applications.

## 🧠 Project Scenario

A large retailer (e.g., Costco) is preparing to launch a new internal dashboard to monitor product inventory and supplier performance across stores. As a business analyst, I was responsible for simulating a real UAT process — from tester feedback tracking to summarizing insights for key stakeholders.

## 🗣️ Why I Built This

Breaking into business analysis requires both theory *and* practical demonstration. This project gave me a hands-on start with UAT — a critical real-world skill — and allowed me to showcase how I would approach real business testing, communicate clearly, and think analytically.
